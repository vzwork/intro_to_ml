# intro_to_ml
My bootcamp project for the "intro to the machine learning" section

1. Scan the data
2. Create training data, validation data, and test data
3. Test the precision of the different algorithms
   - Try different hyperparameters
   - Short review
4. Test the precision of the prime model with the test data
5. Model sanity check
